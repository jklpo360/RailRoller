# RailRoller
Assistant for the 1970s game Boxcars (acquired by Avalon Hill in 1977 and renamed to Rail Baron)

### Currently in progress:
Integrating NLP to parse oral inputs to allow a smoother input process during tabletop gameplay
Adding a graphical user interface to allow more seamless use of the assistant

Developing a modern online version of the game in Godot 4 based on the 1999 [RBP software](https://www.railgamefans.com/rbp/rbpmaps.htm#u21), which will be available in the brower similar to [what has been done for catan](https://colonist.io/).
